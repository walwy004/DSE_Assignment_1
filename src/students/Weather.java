/*
 * === Custom Feature: Weather System ===
 * On each turn, the WeatherManager determines if a weather event occurs.
 * - Drought (10%): crops do not age (tick is skipped)
 * - Flood (10%): all Apples and Grain are wiped out and replaced with UntilledSoil
 * This feature introduces environmental randomness and challenges the player to plan ahead.
